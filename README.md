// Identity verification without revealing specifics
circuit IdentityVerification {
    private field name;
    private field mentalHealthCondition;
    public field conditionCategory;
    public field nullifier;
}

// Rate limiting nullifiers for spam prevention
circuit MembershipRLN {
    private field identitySecret;
    private field messageContent;
    public field nullifier;
    public field epoch;
}

// Economic bonding for group participation
circuit EconomicBonding {
    private field userSecret;
    private field bondAmount;
    public field groupId;
    public field bondCommitment;
}
```
