    private field specializations;
    public field credentialHash;
    public field verificationLevel;
    public field complianceStatus;
}

// Legal case matching without exposing case details
circuit LegalCaseMatching {
    private field caseType;
    private field clientNeeds;
    private field urgencyLevel;
    private field budgetRange;
    private field attorneySpecialties;
    private field attorneyExperience;
    public field matchScore;
    public field compatibilityProof;
}

// Identity verification for legal platform
